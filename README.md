Exercise 8.4

Write a program to open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line,
split the line into a list of words using the split function.

For each word, check to see if the word is already in a list. If the word is not in the
list, add it to the list.

When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical
order.
